# Apple Lib

Welcome to Apple Lib. I am Brandon Han, an undergraduate student at UW-Madison
studying Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics. This library
is a result of my stubborn overuse of Java. 

Originally created for my reinforcement learning research project, Apple Lib
contains a small assortment of potentially useful structures. Documentation for
each class may be found in the README files in the respective directories. To 
use Apple Lib in your own projects, simply add apple_lib.jar to your class path.

## Contents

 - [Neural networks](ann/README.md)
 - [Linear programming](lp/README.md)
 - Function outlines, mostly used for artificial neural networks 

## Side Notes

I named this archive Apple Lib because I like apples.
